# HG002-Variant-Calling-Pipeline
A reproducible variant calling pipeline for HG002 PacBio HiFi reads, implemented using Nextflow (DSL2), Singularity, and SLURM. It identifies genetic variants across chromosomes 1-22 using Clair3 and DeepVariant (v1.6.1), benchmarking results against the GIAB v4.2.1 truth set.
